## Plan for this lab:
### 13.10.2023/20.10.2023
introduction to simple networks, numpy implementation of Perceptron and MLP

### 27.10.2024
The deadline for returning the code from numpy implementation of Perceptron and MLP labs.

Additionally:

intro to pytorch, pytorch implementation of Perceptron and MLP

### 10.11.2023
Pytorch data handling

### 17.11.2023 
Pytorch models, training, debugging

### 24.11.2023 
The deadline for pytorch tasks

And:

Dividing the class into groups, each group will choose a topic for a project. Please prepare a topic for a project until this date. Can be anything related to neural networks, but it should be something that you can implement **before 26.01.2024**

### 26.01.2024/02.02.2024
project presentations and grading
